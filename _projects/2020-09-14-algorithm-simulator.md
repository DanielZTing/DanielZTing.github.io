It seems like there's a simulator for everything, whether it be flights, goats, or yandere. But have you ever wondered what it feels like to be a sorting algorithmâ€½ No? Well, now you can find out anyways! In *Algorithm Simulator*, inspired by Timo Bingmann's widely viewed [15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg), you control an algorithm operating on an array, trying to sort as fast as possible. With ten different levels, a cool visualization, and sound effects, you can fulfill your sorting dreams...

A demo (large download warning: ~5 MB gzipped) is available on the repository's [Github Pages](https://danielzting.github.io/algorithm-simulator). It requires a desktop browser with support for WebAssembly and WebGL. Use it to make a lecture a little more interesting, study for your sorting algorithms certification, or annoy the neighbors with the sound...
